# CS250 - Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?


Interpreting user needs involves gathering information in things like interviews and surveys, and translating the given info  into actionable items. Creating "user stories" aids in this process by framing from the user's perspective, helps prioritize features and align  efforts with user needs. When developing programs, for my approach I start with gathering requirements, followed by some prototyping, development, and testing. It is vital to keep incorporating feedback throughout the process. In my future development work, I aim to incorporate agile processes such as Scrum, to emphasize collaboration, adaptability, and promise on delivery. Being a good team member in software development requires effective communication, collaboration, adaptability, problem-solving, accountability, and a commitment to continuous learning, all of which contribute to delivering more high-quality software products that meet user needs and expectations.
